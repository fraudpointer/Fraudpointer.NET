/// FraudPointer Server has been designed to identify the device that is connected to your server and 
/// is using your e-shop. We can identify it with pretty much high accurracy. This section describes
/// what you have to do in order to allow FraudPointer Server work to this target.
/// 
/// <h2>HTML Output</h2>
///
/// <b>After</b> having created a Fraudpointer.API.Models.AssessmentSession, you need to serve your customer
/// the html page with a javascript reference to FraudPointer <c>fp.js</c> script. Hence, the resulting html
/// output of your, probably, dynamic <c>.aspx</c> page should give something like that:
///
/// \code
<head>
 ......
  <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="https://production.fraudpointer.com/fp.js"></script>
 ......
 </head>
\endcode
///
/// This script defines the <c>fraudpointer.fp()</c> function that you need to call at some point in time. 
/// A suggestion is to call it after your document is loaded.
///
/// You can do that as follows:
/// \code
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
window.onload = function() {
  fraudpointer.fp(.......);   
}
</script>
\endcode
///
/// The point here is that you have to pass there the DOM identifier of an <c>input</c> tag of type 
/// <c>hidden</c>. Which by return needs to hold the value of the Fraudpointer.API.Models.AssessmentSession.Id.
/// Assuming that this <c>hidden input</c> has DOM identifier <c>fp_sid</c>, then the above snippet becomes:
/// \code
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
window.onload = function() {
  fraudpointer.fp('fp_sid');   
}
</script>
\endcode
///
/// We have said that this <c>fp_sid</c> html element needs to have as value the Id of the Fraudpointer.API.Models.AssessmentSession.
/// Assuming that this is, for example, <c>34567</c>, html needs to have something like the following, somewhere in its body:
/// \code
...
<input type='hidden' id='fp_sid' value='34567'/>
...
\endcode
///
/// Summing up, the html output sent to your customer's computer has to contain content similar to the following:
/// \code
<html>
<head>
	.... other head stuff goes here .....
	<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="https://production.fraudpointer.com/fp.js"></script>
	<script>
		window.onload = function() {
			fraudpointer.fp('fp_sid');
		}
	</script>
	..... other head stuff goes here .....
</head>
<body>
 .... other body elements go here .....
 <input type="hidden" id="fp_sid" value="34567"/>
 .... other body elements go here .....
</body>
</html>
\endcode
///
/// This is enough for FraudPointer Service to collect device related data from your customer's device.
///
/// <hr/>
/// <h3>Hints:</h3>
///
/// <b>1) Filling in the AssessmentSession Id using server side code</b>:
///
/// Assuming that you are using a dynamic page like ".aspx", you can have the following ASP .NET control
/// in your <c>.aspx</c> code:
///
/// \code
<asp:HiddenField ID="hdnfldFpSessionId" runat="server" />
\endcode
///
/// ... and on your <c>Page_Load</c> method of your page, you can set the <c>Value</c> after having got the
/// Fraudpointer.API.Models.AssessmentSession from FraudPointer Server. This is an example snippet:
///
/// \code
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{

  IClient client = ClientFactory.Construct("https://production.fraudpointer.com/api",
                                                     "123497129834wabcd12398fed");
  AssessmentSession assessmentSession = client.CreateAssessmentSession();
  hdnfldFpSessionId.Value = assessmentSession.Id.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);

}
\endcode
/// However, if you do that, pay attention to the actual document id that ASP .NET generates for this
/// asp control. It is not alwasy <c>hdnfldFpSessionId</c> (depends on the context).
///
/// <b>2) Using jQuery</b>:
///
/// If you are using <c>jQuery</c> you can always call <c>fraudpointer.fp()</c> function on your <c>document ready</c>
/// handler. So, instead of writing something like <c>window.onload = function () {.....}</c> as we had above, you can
/// write something like:
/// \code
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function() {
    fraudpointer.fp($('#fp_sid').val());
});
</script>
\endcode
///
